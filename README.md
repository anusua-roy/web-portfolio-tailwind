**Project Name:** 
Web Portfolio

**Description:**
I am a React Developer and have been meaning to learn Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This is a very basic web portfolio made from HTML and designed solely with Tailwind. I decided to create this for mainly two purpose
1. I wanted to have a website for myself
2. I wanted to create a basic project using Tailwind

**Credits:**
I was refering to the course from Udemy **Tailwind CSS From Scratch | Learn By Building Projects by Brad Traversy.** I have so far only gone through the fundamentals and not completed the full course yet, and I still have somewhat a good understanding of the Tailwind classes.
Also, I have used icons and fonts from **Font Awesome and Google Fonts.**
